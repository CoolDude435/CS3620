Processes Creation and Management
2. 
a. There are many possibilities since the parent process 
needs to wait for both child processes to exit before itself exits, 
but the order in which its children exit doesn´t matter, so in 
the example given, P2 need to wait for its children P5 and P6 to exit,
but it could either exit in the order 56 or 65 and both would be valid.
b. 1234560 is not possible since P0 can´t exit and 
print until its children P1 and P2 exit.

STrace
1. The program "echo" was executed with its path being "/bin/echo"
2. The one argument passed was the string "hello world from strace\n"
3. File descriptor one is STDOUT (standard output) and file descriptor two
   is STDERR (standard error)
4. When the program writes to file descriptor 1 it displays the content
   in the terminal
5. The program outputs a 0 to the OS letting it now it executed with no errors.

Processes Creation and Management
2. *Note: assumption is the print comes before forking its children,
          rather than right before exit
a. There are many possibilities since the scheduler can decide to either
execute the parent or the 1st child process after the fork. If it executes
the child process first than it will print before the 2nd child is created
and prints, ie 256. But if the scheduler decides to execute the parent and
continue with its 2nd child process than it will print before the 1st child,
ie 265. But both are valid.
b. 1234560 is not possible since P0 have to have already executed its
print before creating its children.

STrace
1. The program "echo" was executed with its path being "/bin/echo"
2. The one argument passed was the string "hello world from strace\n"
3. File descriptor one is STDOUT (standard output) and file descriptor two
   is STDERR (standard error)
4. When the program writes to file descriptor 1 it displays the content
   in the terminal
5. The program outputs a 0 to the OS letting it now it executed with no errors.
